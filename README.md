# PCOS-cortisol-KEGG_analysis
This project represent my KEGG analysis PCOS microarray data where I unveil various biological pathways involve in this condition
The main pathways are related to cell signalling/proliferating in Breast cancer and immune/inflammatory pathways in Viral protein interaction with cytokine. 



The significant enrichment of the Viral Protein Interaction with Cytokine and Cytokine Receptor pathway in the PCOS dataset highlights the central role of chronic low-grade inflammation in PCOS pathogenesis. While the pathway name references viral mechanisms, its functional core—cytokine and chemokine signaling—is a master regulator of immune and inflammatory responses.
Key Genes Identified:
Pro-inflammatory Mediators: IL6 (Interleukin-6) and its receptor subunit IL6ST (GP130).
Chemotactic Signals: CXCL2, CXCL5, CCL26 (chemokines recruiting immune cells).
Receptor: CCR1 (chemokine receptor).
Pathophysiological Relevance to PCOS:
Exacerbates Insulin Resistance: Inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6) directly interfere with insulin signaling.
Promotes Androgen Excess: Cytokines stimulate ovarian theca-cell and adrenal androgen production.
Drives Long-Term Complications: Sustained inflammation underpins the elevated risks of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in PCOS.

Interpretation:
The upregulation of these genes suggests active recruitment of immune cells (e.g., macrophages, neutrophils) to ovarian or adipose tissues, creating a pro-inflammatory microenvironment that disrupts ovarian function, glucose metabolism, and steroidogenesis. This result reinforces the paradigm of PCOS as a systemic inflammatory disorder and provides molecular targets linking immune dysregulation to its clinical features.

Significant enrichment of the Breast Cancer pathway in the PCOS dataset, reflecting shared dysregulation of core cellular proliferation and signaling mechanisms—not an indication of increased breast cancer risk. This highlights PCOS as a disorder of abnormal tissue growth and cell communication.

Key Genes Identified:
WNT/β-catenin signaling: WNT5A, FZD7
Notch signaling: JAG1, HES1, HEY1
Growth factors: FGF1, FGF18
Signaling adapters: SHC3, SHC4
Pathophysiological Relevance to PCOS:
Follicular Arrest: Disrupted proliferation/apoptosis balance in ovarian follicles.
Theca Cell Hyperplasia: Androgen-producing ovarian cell overgrowth driven by cancer-like pathways.
Metabolic Dysregulation: Overlap with insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathways central to PCOS insulin resistance.

Interpretation:
The pathway enrichment suggests that PCOS involves dysregulation of fundamental developmental and proliferative signaling cascades (Wnt, Notch, FGF), leading to ovarian dysfunction and contributing to hyperandrogenism and metabolic features.

Potential Link to Cortisol (HPA Axis):
IL6 (from Cytokine Pathway): Directly stimulates the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, promoting cortisol release. Elevated IL6 in PCOS may contribute to a dysregulated stress response and altered cortisol levels.
SHC3/SHC4 & FGFs (from Breast Cancer Pathway): These are key signaling adapters/growth factors in pathways (e.g., insulin/IGF-1) that cross-talk with glucocorticoid receptor signaling. Their dysregulation could indirectly influence tissue-specific cortisol sensitivity and metabolism, though this is a more complex, secondary effect.
