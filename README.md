# PCOS-cortisol-KEGG_analysis
This project represent my KEGG analysis PCOS microarray data where I unveil various biological pathways involve in this condition
The main pathways are related to cell signalling/proliferating in Breast cancer and immune/inflammatory pathways in Viral protein interaction with cytokine. 



The significant enrichment of the Viral Protein Interaction with Cytokine and Cytokine Receptor pathway in the PCOS dataset highlights the central role of chronic low-grade inflammation in PCOS pathogenesis. While the pathway name references viral mechanisms, its functional core—cytokine and chemokine signaling—is a master regulator of immune and inflammatory responses.
Key Genes Identified:
Pro-inflammatory Mediators: IL6 (Interleukin-6) and its receptor subunit IL6ST (GP130).
Chemotactic Signals: CXCL2, CXCL5, CCL26 (chemokines recruiting immune cells).
Receptor: CCR1 (chemokine receptor).
Pathophysiological Relevance to PCOS:
Exacerbates Insulin Resistance: Inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6) directly interfere with insulin signaling.
Promotes Androgen Excess: Cytokines stimulate ovarian theca-cell and adrenal androgen production.
Drives Long-Term Complications: Sustained inflammation underpins the elevated risks of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in PCOS.
Interpretation:
The upregulation of these genes suggests active recruitment of immune cells (e.g., macrophages, neutrophils) to ovarian or adipose tissues, creating a pro-inflammatory microenvironment that disrupts ovarian function, glucose metabolism, and steroidogenesis. This result reinforces the paradigm of PCOS as a systemic inflammatory disorder and provides molecular targets linking immune dysregulation to its clinical features.
